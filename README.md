 * Learner
 * Letter Test

# To Do

# Use Guidelines
Interact with the app and find "pain points" and note them for future iteration.

# Special Instructions
There is currently a bug that the tone player misses the first or second tone the first time playing a letter after freshly loading the application. Press "play" twice on the first application load as a temporary workaround.
